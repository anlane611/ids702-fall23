    "text": "Developing an understanding of statistical modeling is a key component of becoming a data scientist. Statistical models are used to answer research questions and obtain meaningful insights from many kinds of data.\nBroadly, this course will cover the following topics:\n\nLinear Regression\nGeneralized Linear Models\nSpecial topics, including survival models and hierarchical models\n\nBut here in the MIDS program, understanding the content is only the beginning. Successful data scientists are critical thinkers, problem solvers, effective communicators, and enthusiastic collaborators. With that in mind, this course aims to meet four key learning objectives:\nBy the end of the course, students should be able to\n\nFit and interpret statistical models, including linear and generalized linear models.\nMap a research question and dataset to the appropriate statistical model\nMake careful and critical decisions about model building and real-world implications\nCommunicate (through written and oral communication) model results to a broad audience\n\nRequired textbook: \nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, 2nd edition by James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., and Tibshirani, R.\nUse the link above to download a PDF of the book"
